Quakbot, alternatively recognized as QakBot or Qbot, is categorized as a banking trojan and modular malware with a documented history of activity dating back to at least 2007. Initially devised with the intent of pilfering banking credentials and personal financial data, Quakbot has undergone iterative refinement over the years, assuming a more multifaceted and enduring threat profile. It is notably distinguished for its capacity to rapidly propagate across networks, employing tactics such as exploiting vulnerabilities, executing brute-force assaults, and leveraging purloined authentication credentials.
